## About Me 🌌
Hey there! I'm Tasneem, but you might know me as Aurorabtw. I'm a quiet, upbeat coder with a passion for C++ and Python. I often find myself in a cycle of starting projects, putting in the work, and... well, sometimes they end up in a cozy forgotten corner! This repository is my personal space to revisit and share those projects with you.

## What's Inside? 🚀
This repository is my “Project Vault” – a place where ideas, snippets, and mini-projects live and breathe (or maybe gather dust). Here’s a quick tour of what you’ll find:

### Project Archive 📂
A collection of my projects, big and small. Some are finished, some are forever "in progress," and others just here for a laugh.

### The Idea Haven 💡
A little notebook for those ideas that spark at 2 AM and fade by 10 AM. I write down the ones that might one day see the light.

### Python Playground 🐍 & C++ Corner 🚀
Dedicated sections where I tinker with my favorite languages. You’ll find:
- Handy snippets
- Code experiments
- Tiny algorithms, cool tricks, and maybe some bug fixes if I remember to come back to them!

## Why This Repository? ✨
The purpose of this space is to capture the journey, the trial and error, and the sparks of creativity that make coding fun. If you stumble across something here that speaks to you, feel free to contribute or reach out! And if you just want to look around, enjoy this little window into my world.
